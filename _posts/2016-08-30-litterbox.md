The giant ugly gray igloo in the corner is Pye’s litterbox. Next to it is a thing that looks like a tiny plastic toilet, called a Litter Genie. You can scoop her poop into the litter genie. It has a little shelf that you pull out when you’re scooping, and it seals away odors! Great for tiny urban apartments. Note: I am not trying to sell you the Litter Genie.

There are additional litterbox bags, pine litter, and litter genie replacements in the cabinet with Pye’s food and in the front closet. You should not have to mess with these. If I end up in a coma, someone please change her litterbox for me until I wake up, okay?
