There is a fishing rod with a feather that Pye loves chasing around. She will also chase after loose strings. If you are staying overnight, she may soak one of her toys in her water dish, and then leave it inside your shoe. So sweet! Her favorite toy is crumpled up receipts &mdash; she will play fetch if you throw one across the room. If you start crumpling paper or aluminum, she will run over towards you. Note: If you play receipt fetch, please dispose of the receipt in the garbage can in the kitchen when you are done. Otherwise Pye will shred the receipt into tiny scraps all over my couch. If you throw the receipt away in a non-lidded garbage can, she will knock the can over to recover it.
