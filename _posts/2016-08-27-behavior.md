Pye is sometimes afraid of strangers and will hide under the bed covers. If that’s the case, just let her hang there until she’s comfortable. She usually only does this when groups of 3 or more people are over.

Don’t open the window in the bedroom that doesn’t have a screen. She might jump out of it.

Pye scratches my furniture a lot. This is not ideal, but I just let her do it anyway.

Pye bites sometimes, but not hard. She will probably only bite if you are playing with her with your hands. Sometimes she will love bite you while you are petting her. You can spray her with the water bottle if she bites too hard. She HATES being sprayed with the water bottle.

Pye is also really curious. Did you bring a bag with you? She will stick her head in it and chew on your important papers, or take a nap on top of it.
