This is the most important thing! Thank you for keeping my cat alive!

Pye’s food and water dish are under the counter behind the dining table.

Once a day, dump out yesterday’s water and give her fresh water. Her kibble in the cabinet just to the right of her food. Once a day, fill her bowl with kibble. (Note: she almost never eats all of the kibble from the day before. You do not need to dump out yesterday’s kibble, unless it’s looking particularly gross.)

Her favorite thing in this world is wet food. If you are feeding her, she is probably tripping over your feet and screaming about wet food.

In the top shelf of the fridge door, there is a row of canned cat food. Once a day, give her a small pie slice of canned food (about 1/8th of the can) on top of her kibble. If you’re unable to feed her the next day or won’t be able to come back for a while, give her more. She LOVES this stuff.
